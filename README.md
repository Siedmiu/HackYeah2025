# HackYeah2025 - Open controller
### Physical components:
* ESP dev kit C - main microcontroller colecting data from sensors
* accelerometer - sensor to detect jump
* 2 x IMU - sensors on the hands to detect movement and gestures
* joystick
* Tacktile switches

### Project information
The aim of the project is to create an open-source, easy-to-build, and affordable controller that can encourage young people to be physically active and have fun while playing games.
We are creating interactive controller on two hands and body, which can detect movement and "jump" interactions in game.

Our project will be completely open-source, allowing people to create their own movement patterns for different games.

We will develop the integration of our controller with Minecraft bow-shooting and parkour activities, but the controller can be configured for any chosen game through custom hotkey mapping.

### Technological stack
* Platfotm IO (Arduino framework) 
* Python:  desktop aplication (Qt); training neural network for gesture detection;
